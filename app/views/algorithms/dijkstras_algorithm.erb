  <h1>Dijkstra's algorithm</h1>

  <div>
    Finds the shortest path from one vertex in a graph to another.
    Doesn't work on graph with negative edge weights. For that,
    you'll want to try the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

      The runtime performance can be improved by using a min-heap to
      efficiently find the next vertex to visit during each iteration
      of the outer loop.
