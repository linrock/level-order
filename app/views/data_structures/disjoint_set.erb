<h1>Disjoint set</h1>

<div>
  Tracks elements grouped into disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.

  Time complexity:
  Union   O(N)
  Find    O(N)

  Space complexity: O(N)
</div>

<div>
  By using path compression and union by rank, the time complexity
  of the union and find operations are reduced to constant time.
